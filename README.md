# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Number Guesser Game 

I used Reactjs and Vite for this project 

step 1: created a state variable to serve a function that generates a number between 1 and 100

step 2: defined the number of attempts

step 3: grabbed the players input value

step 4: compared the input value with the secret number and passed a response depending on the input ("too low", "too high" or "correct")

step 5: Tarck the attempts (set the attempts to only 3 trials)

step 6: Displays the win response if player gets the secret number within the attemtps

step 7: Repeat the same process again until the number of players attempts is exhausted

step 8: End Game
